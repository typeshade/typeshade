# `"use typeshade"` language surface

Status: **on `main`** as of `2605a27` (PR #5 squash). Design freeze for layout / entry / data types.
Does not replace `docs/use-typeshade-plan.md` (IR phases 0–22). This document is the **author-facing grammar**.
`fn()` remains the IR equality oracle. Product code uses `"use typeshade"`.

North star: TypeScript syntax only where the TS parser already accepts it. No preprocessor. No second IR.

```
type Camera = { … }                 value struct (or class + field attrs)
class VsIn { @location(0) … }       value struct + per-field metadata
declare const camera: uniform<T>    resource slot (host fills)
declare let pixels: storage<T>      resource slot, writable
@compute([64]) export function      entry
@vertex / @fragment export function entry
```

GPU has three things. The grammar has three places.

| GPU              | TypeShade                                      | `@` allowed?                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Buffer / UBO     | `declare const/let` + `uniform<T>` / `storage<T>` | No (const cannot take decorators)     |
| Value layout     | `class` fields or `type` alias                 | Yes, on **class fields only**         |
| Shader stage     | top-level `export function`                    | `@compute` `@vertex` `@fragment`      |

Do not put an entry method on a class. Do not use a class as a bind group.

---

## 1. Resources — `declare`

Host-owned. No initializer. Slot index = source order of `declare` in the file.

```ts
"use typeshade"

declare const camera: uniform<Camera>
declare const src: storage<f32>
declare let pixels: storage<f32>
```

| Declaration | Space | Access |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| `declare const x: uniform<T>` | uniform | read |
| `declare const x: storage<T>` | storage | read |
| `declare let x: storage<T>` | storage | read_write |
| `declare const x: T` | illegal | space required |
| `declare let x: uniform<T>` | illegal | uniform is const |

Writes to a read-only resource are a compile error.

Duplicate `@group @binding` is an error.

Sketch form still exists and occupies the same slot sequence:

```ts
const scale = uniform<f32>()
let xs = storage<f32>()
```

Product code should use `declare`. Mixing `declare` and call form in one file shares one slot counter; collisions still error.

`var` is not a resource declaration.

---

## 2. Value types — `type`, `interface` and `class`

Plain data without field metadata uses a type alias:

```ts
type Camera = {
  view: mat4
  pos: vec3
}
```

`interface Camera { view: mat4; pos: vec3 }` is the same struct written a third way. A class,
a type alias over an object type, and an interface all produce one `StructDecl`; the compiler
accepts all three.

A `type`/`interface` struct is the members written in it: a method or call signature, an
index signature, an optional (`a?: f32`) member, and an `interface … extends …` are each
rejected, since a WGSL struct has no form for them and silently dropping one would change
the buffer layout the host fills.

Field metadata (`@location`, `@align`, `@size`, `@offset`, `@builtin`, `@interpolate`, `@ignore`) requires a **class field**. Interfaces and type-literal members cannot carry TS decorators, so a struct used as entry I/O — where WGSL requires `@builtin` or `@location` on every member — has to be a class.

```ts
class Camera {
  @align(16)
  view: mat4
  pos: vec3
}

class VsIn {
  @location(0) position: vec3
  @location(1) @interpolate("linear") uv: vec2
}
```

Of that list the compiler applies `@location` and `@builtin` today. `@align` on a field is
an error (`TS8010`) rather than a silent no-op — the `@align(16)` above is *(target)*.
`@size`, `@offset`, `@interpolate` and `@ignore` parse but do not reach the emitted struct yet.

`class` here is a struct with attributes, not an object.

Forbidden on these classes:

- `new Camera()` as a resource
- `extends` (`TS8010`: the base's fields would silently vanish from the layout)
- methods that close over `declare` resources
- `@compute` / `@vertex` / `@fragment` methods
- constructors, `this` as a pipeline
- no fields at all — a struct with an empty field list has no WGSL form
- a field name that is not a plain identifier (`"my-field": f32`, `[key]: f32`)

Pure methods that only read `this` fields may land later as free functions. Not in the first class slice.

A struct is collected only when something **uses** it: a `declare` binding's `uniform<T>` /
`storage<T>` argument, a parameter, return or local annotation, or a field of another struct
that is itself used. Naming it in another TYPE declaration is not using it — `type Params =
Config`, `Config[]`, `Config | undefined` and `Readonly<Config>` all describe a type rather
than consume one, so none of them makes `Config` a shader struct. A `type` or `interface`
declaration nothing consumes is not a shader type at all — it may be a host-side shape
(`type Opts = { seed: number }`) — and is left alone, neither checked nor emitted. A `class`
is always collected, as it always has been.

One name, one declaration. A second class, interface or type alias of the same name is an
error, **including two interfaces**, which TypeScript itself would merge: the merged layout
would disagree with the one emitted here at every use site, so the ambiguity is refused
rather than silently resolved.

`declare` is the bind-group spelling; an `interface` is a value layout like any other.

---

## 3. Entries — function decorators and explicit builtins

Shader-stage inputs are **explicit function parameters**. TypeShade does not inject `gid`, `vid`, or `pid` as implicit globals.

```ts
@compute([64, 1, 1])
export function paint(
  @builtin("global_invocation_id") gid: vec3u
) {
  pixels[gid.x] += camera.pos.x
}

@vertex
export function vs(
  @builtin("vertex_index") vid: u32,
  vin: VsIn
): vec4 {
  return camera.view * vec4(vin.position, 1)
}

@fragment
export function fs(
  @builtin("position") pid: vec4
): vec4 {
  return vec4(pid.x, 0, 0, 1)
}
```

- No stage decorator → helper, not an entry.
- Builtins are ordinary entry parameters with `@builtin(...)` metadata.
- A builtin is not a hidden global; its dependency is visible in the function signature.
- The builtin name must match the target backend's supported builtin set.
- Workgroup size is the only payload on `@compute`. Default `[1, 1, 1]` if omitted as `@compute`.
- `@compute({ workgroup: [64, 1, 1] })` is accepted as an alias.

---

## 4. What we will not do

| Idea | Why not |
|------|--------|
| `@uniform const scale` | TS does not parse decorators on `const` |
| `class Scene { @compute paint() {} }` | `this` is not a GPU instance |
| Static class as bind group | Extra ban list; emit `.d.ts` instead |
| Per-decl binding numbers as the happy path | Host mismatch is silent on GPU |
| JS `Array` / lambdas / `filter` length change | IR + WGSL constraints |
| Implicit `gid` / `vid` / `pid` globals | Hidden stage inputs make dependencies less explicit |
| Recursion, direct or mutual | WGSL has no call stack; Tint rejects the module outright. The check is SYNTACTIC, so a call in code the optimizer would drop (`if (false) { f() }`, an unread `const x = f()`) is a cycle too. That is stricter than Tint for that class, and deliberately so: matching the optimizer would accept `if (false)` and reject `if (DEBUG)` for `const DEBUG: bool = false`, which no author could predict |

---

## 5. Lowering

```
declare const camera: uniform<Camera>
        → BindingDecl { name, space: "uniform", binding: N, type: Camera }

declare let pixels: storage<f32>
        → BindingDecl { space: "storage", access: "read_write", … }

camera / pixels in a function
        → varref (resource scope)

class Camera { view, pos }
        → StructDecl + field attrs

@builtin("global_invocation_id") gid: vec3u
        → entry parameter + builtin metadata

@compute([64]) export function paint
        → FuncDecl + workgroup metadata
```

Same Expr / Stmt / FuncDecl / BindingDecl / StructDecl as the EDSL.

---

## 6. Implementation order

1. **Landed on main:** `declare` + `uniform<T>` / `storage<T>` → BindingDecl, varref, WGSL, duplicate-slot errors.
2. **`@compute([x,y,z])` + explicit builtin parameters** in that function only.
3. **`class` as StructDecl.** Fields without decorators first (`uniform<Camera>`).
4. **Field decorators** `@align` `@location` `@size` `@offset` `@ignore`.
5. **`@vertex` / `@fragment`** + explicit builtin and `VsIn` locations.
6. Reflect JSON + optional `.d.ts` for `declare` names.

Do not start Execution Graph or class methods before 2–4 are green.

---

## 7. Diagnostics (required)

| Situation | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| `declare const x: f32` | need `uniform<T>` or `storage<T>` |
| `declare let x: uniform<T>` | uniform must be `declare const` |
| assign to `declare const` resource | read-only |
| two resources share `@binding` | name both |
| builtin parameter on an incompatible stage | stage mismatch |
| `@compute` method on a class | entries are top-level functions |
| a function that reaches itself, directly or through other functions | `TS8031` on the call that closes the cycle, naming the whole cycle |
| `.length` on an `array<T>` with no `N`, anywhere | `TS8032`. For a `storage` array the length is the bound buffer's and needs `arrayLength` (unspelled today); for a local, a parameter or a `uniform<array<T>>` the fix is an explicit size, `array<f32, 3>` |

---

## 8. Example

Compiles today. `@align(16)` on `view` is part of the frozen grammar (§2) but the compiler
rejects it (`TS8010`, "`@align` on a field is not applied"), so it is left out here.

```ts
"use typeshade"

class Camera {
  view: mat4
  pos: vec3
}

declare const camera: uniform<Camera>
declare let pixels: storage<array<f32>>

@compute([64, 1, 1])
export function paint(
  @builtin("global_invocation_id") gid: vec3u
) {
  const i = gid.x
  pixels[i] = pixels[i] + camera.pos.x
}
```

**Rule:** a target example — grammar this document freezes but the compiler does not accept
yet — stays in this document, is labelled *(target)*, and is never copied into `README.md`,
the org profile, or any other front-facing page. Those pages carry only examples that
compile, which `src/compiler/ts/doc-snippets.test.ts` enforces.

**Numbering:** §§9, 10 and 12 to 15 are reserved for issue #8's A2, A6, A9, A3, A10 and A7,
which are in flight on their own branches and append here in issue order. The sections below
took the next free numbers so the A-item branches do not all claim §9 and collide on merge.

---

## 11. Vector constructors

A `vecN` constructor either **composes** a vector out of parts of its own element type, or
**converts** one whole vector of the same size:

```ts
vec3(a, b, c)        // compose: three f32
vec3(0.5)            // splat
vec4(v3, 1.)         // compose from a vec3 and a scalar
vec4(v2, v2)         // compose from two vec2
vec3f(v)             // convert: v is a vec3u, every component becomes an f32
vec3u(v)             // convert the other way
vec2(gid.xy)         // convert a vec2<u32> swizzle to vec2<f32>
```

The converting form is WGSL's `vecN<T>(e: vecN<S>)` and GLSL ES 3.00's `vec3(uv)`, and the
EDSL's `vec3(v)` builds the same node. It needs exactly one argument, a vector of the
constructor's own size; a vector of another size and a mixed list such as `vec3(v2u, 1.)`
stay rejected, as WGSL rejects them.

The conversion follows **WGSL's** scalar conversion, which is what WebGPU and the CPU oracle
both give you: a float source saturates into an integer target (`vec3u(vec3(-3.2, …))` is
`0`, not `-3`), and `i32` and `u32` are reinterpreted two's-complement. An emulated-double
vector is not converted this way.

**GLSL ES 3.00 does not promise that.** It leaves an out-of-range or NaN float→int conversion
undefined, and the WebGL2 context the compile gate uses disagrees with WGSL on exactly those
inputs — measured against an RGBA32UI target, `uvec3(vec3(1e30)).x` reads back `0` where the
oracle gives `4294967040`, `ivec3(vec3(1e30)).x` reads `-2147483648` where the oracle gives
`2147483520`, and `uvec3(vec3(NaN)).x` reads `2147483648` where the oracle gives `0`. The
`-3.2` above happens to agree, and an in-range source always does. So the cross-backend
ground a portable shader can stand on is **in-range values**; clamp before you convert if the
source might not be.

## 16. Object literals take the declared struct

Which struct `{ … }` builds comes from the type the position **declares**: a function's
return type, a `let`/`const` annotation, or a parameter type.

```ts
"use typeshade"

class VsOut {
  @builtin("position") pos: vec4
  @location(0) uv: vec2
}

class FsIn {
  @builtin("position") pos: vec4
  @location(0) uv: vec2
}

export function shade(o: FsIn): f32 {
  return o.uv.x
}

@vertex
export function vs(@builtin("vertex_index") i: u32): VsOut {
  const p = vec2(0., 0.)
  return { pos: vec4(p, 0., 1.), uv: p } // the return type says VsOut
}

export function pick(): f32 {
  const a: FsIn = { pos: vec4(0., 0., 0., 1.), uv: vec2(0., 0.) } // the annotation says FsIn
  return shade(a) + shade({ pos: a.pos, uv: a.uv }) // the parameter says FsIn
}
```

Matching the field **names** against the struct table is the fallback, for a position that
declares nothing (`const o = { … }` with no annotation). It stays because it is often enough,
but it could never answer the case above: `VsOut` and `FsIn` have the same fields, so the name
set does not distinguish them and the literal was rejected inside a function that states
exactly which one it returns.

A declared struct also improves the diagnostics, because there is something to name:

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `return { a: 1. }` for a two-field `P` | `Object literal { a } does not match a known struct.` | `Missing field "b" for struct P.` |
| `return { a: 1., c: 2. }` | `Object literal { a, c } does not match a known struct.` | `Struct P has no field "c".` |

The context reaches **inward**: the struct is resolved before the field values are lowered, so
a nested literal is built against the type of the field it fills. `{ i: { x: 1. } }` for an
`Outer { i: Inner }` picks `Inner` even where a same-shaped `InnerTwin` exists.

**Three positions declare a type, and they are the three above.** These four do not, and each
behaves as it did before this item, falling back to name matching: an assignment target
(`o = { … }`, since the annotation is on the declaration and not on the assignment), a ternary
arm, an array or vector constructor argument, and a literal in any other expression position.
A twin is unresolvable in all four.

A contextual type that is not a struct is ignored here rather than reported: `const o: f32 =
{ a: 1. }` is a mistake about the declaration, and the declaration's own type check is what
says so.

A **repeated** field keeps taking the last value, in every position, as it always has:
`{ a: 1., a: 2., b: 3. }` builds `P(2., 3.)`. TypeScript's own `TS1117` reports it in the
editor, so the compiler does not repeat the complaint.
