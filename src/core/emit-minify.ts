// ═══ Shader DSL — emitted-text minifier ═══
//
// Whitespace/comment compaction of an ALREADY-EMITTED WGSL / GLSL ES 3.00
// string, over the shared lexer (`shader-lex.ts`). Provably token-safe because
// of two language facts:
//   • neither language has string literals — a `//` always starts a comment,
//     and whitespace is never significant inside any token;
//   • a newline is ordinary whitespace EXCEPT around GLSL preprocessor
//     directives (`#version`, `#extension`), which must sit on their own line
//     — directive lines pass through verbatim (internal runs collapsed to one
//     space).
//
// The minifier LEXES the text and re-emits the token stream, so it does not
// have to be conservative about which characters a space may sit between: a
// separator is written iff omitting it would MERGE the boundary, decided by
// re-lexing `prev + next` and checking the first token is still `prev` — the
// same maximal-munch rule the real compilers use. That is one rule covering
// every operator pair (`- -x`, `a / /b`, `<< =`, `1.0 f32`), and it removes the
// spaces the previous structural-punctuation-only rule had to keep (`a=b`,
// `)->f32`, `return -x` stays spaced only where it must).
//
// Three further LOSSLESS shrinks ride on the token stream:
//   • block comments (`/* … */`) join `//` as removable — the DSL does not emit
//     them today, but hand-written `raw`/`rawGlsl` text can;
//   • numeric literals are canonicalised WITHOUT changing their value:
//     `0.500` → `.5`, `1.0` → `1.`, `1.0e-07` → `1e-7`. Never a digit dropped
//     from the significand (`0.800000011920929` is an f32-exact printout — a
//     rounded one is a different number), and never a `.` dropped from a float
//     with no exponent (that would retype it to an integer in WGSL);
//   • a TRAILING comma before `)` / `}` / `]` is dropped — the one token this
//     pass REMOVES rather than re-spells (see CLOSERS for why it is optional).
//
// Idempotent; no semantic change — the compile gates run the minified output on
// real Tint + ANGLE (playground/e2e/_emit-obfuscate-gate.spec.ts).
