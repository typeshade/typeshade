// ═══ Shader DSL — optimization pipeline (Optimization context) ═══
//
// optimize(module) runs an ordered list of correctness-preserving passes, each
// pure (module -> module). The headline value of the node IR: a real optimizing
// compiler, not a transliterator. Correctness is pinned by oracle value-equality
// (every pass must leave compileModule(m) producing identical results) and, once
// it lands (P3), the real-GPU f32 differential.
//
// STATUS — WIRED into BOTH emit paths (#763 H1; this header long claimed "deferred
// until P3" after P3 had landed). emitModule (backends/wgsl.ts `optimize:`) and
// emitGlslModule (backends/glsl.ts `optimize:`) each run the full `fixpoint` pipeline
// over the lowered module on EVERY emit. The f32 concern that once gated the wiring
// is answered by the real-GPU differential (playground/e2e/_optimizer-gpu-parity.spec.ts,
// in CI); correctness is further pinned by the per-pass oracle tests, the projection
// module's oracle bit-equality loop over every proj_* fn
// (map/src/shaders/dsl/optimize.test.ts), and the examples emit-goldens byte gate.

/** The default pipeline. const/copy-prop first (move literals & copies into uses),
 *  then const-fold + algebraic-simplify (collapse the exposed literals / identities),
 *  then dead-branch (drop the control flow those literals decided), then CSE (fn-top
 *  input-only repeats) + cse-local (statement-local repeats that touch a local/var) /
 *  LICM (loop invariants), then DCE last (clean up everything orphaned).
 *
 *  `gvn` completes the CSE family here (#1865): `cse` owns fn-top input-only repeats
 *  and `cseLocal` owns repeats inside ONE statement, which leaves the repeat that
 *  touches a local and spans STATEMENTS — the commonest shape in the real shaders —
 *  to nobody. It was long left unwired because it perturbs emitted bytes, and the
 *  snapshots were regenerated when the measurement made the case: on the production
 *  modules it removes 208 of 6008 IR ops (line 1546 -> 1465, hillshade 657 -> 613,
 *  both per-fragment hot paths). Pure dedup, so the values are bit-identical — the
 *  re-bake moved bytes, never pixels.
 *
 *  NB: whole-function tree-shaking (`deadFnElim`, ./dce-fns), small fixed-count loop
 *  unrolling (`unrollLoops`, ./unroll — #627) and the member-of-construct fold
 *  (`memberFold`, ./member-fold — #1972, applied by `passes/force-inline.ts`) are
 *  still deliberately NOT in this list — like `inlineFn` (../inline), they are
 *  available-but-unwired passes.
 *  The shaders that share a projection prelude emit it as one module of helper fns
 *  + the entry points, so tree-shaking would per-shader-prune the prelude and break
 *  the deliberately byte-stable shared-prelude emit (+ its golden-WGSL drift gate);
 *  unrollLoops duplicates a loop body, likewise perturbing emitted bytes. Wire
 *  either only behind a maintainer decision to regenerate those snapshots. */

/** Run an optimizer pass list over a module ONCE, in order, and return the result. Pure — the

 *
 *  This is the single-sweep primitive. Passes feed each other (const-prop exposes folds, which
 *  expose dead branches, which expose dead code), so one sweep generally leaves further wins on
 *  the table; `fixpoint()` is the same list re-run until the module stops changing, and is what
 *  every backend's own `optimize` hook uses. Reach for `optimize` directly when you want exactly
 *  one pass over a known list — measuring an individual pass's effect, or reproducing a
 *  specific intermediate state.
 *
 *  Prefer `optimizeAt(m, level)` when you want a NAMED tier: {@link OptLevel} `'O1'` is the
 *  bit-exact set, `'O2'` the full one, and those two differ in whether float semantics can move
 *  at all — a distinction a hand-assembled pass list is easy to get wrong.

 *  - `'O0'` — nothing. Naive lowered emit; the size baseline the optimizer is measured against.
 *  - `'O1'` — the bit-exact value-MOVERS only. None of them changes WHICH float ops execute, so
 *    an O1 build's runtime values are bit-identical to O0's on every target.
 *  - `'O2'` — the full pipeline, and the emit default. Adds const-folding on floats, algebraic
 *    identities and LICM — passes that CAN move float semantics, which is why they sit behind
 *    the real-GPU f32 differential gate rather than being on at O1.
